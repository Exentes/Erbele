# Erbele

Erbele is a feature-rich text editor for macOS Sierra. Forked in 2016 from the Fraise github repository which was discontinued years ago, my main interest is to keep the popular app alive.

**See why I [changed the name from "Fraise" to "Erbele"](https://github.com/abentele/Erbele/wiki/Changed-the-name-from-%22Fraise%22-to-%22Erbele%22)** - I would appreciate if all supporters of my project would add a star to my new project on github.

[Fraise 3.7.3](https://github.com/jfmoy/Fraise) was maintained by Jean-Francois Moy, but discontinued.
Fraise originally was forked from [Smultron 3.5.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smultron/), maintained by Peter Borg.

# Releases

See [Releases](https://github.com/abentele/Erbele/releases)

Previous Fraise releases are available on https://github.com/abentele/Fraise/releases.

# Roadmap

Currently my main interest is to fix bugs, enhance already existing features and implement some new features while retaining the original focus and feature-set:
* powerful, but easy to use
* provide many helpful tools to edit texts
* support for many code languages (e.g. syntax highlighting)

For more details, see the [Issues list](https://github.com/abentele/Erbele/issues) and the [Roadmap](https://github.com/abentele/Erbele/projects/1).
