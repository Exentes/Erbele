This is a fork of Fraise 3.7.3 providing the missing support for macOS Sierra (10.12).
Fraise 3.7.3 was maintained by Jean-Francois Moy (https://github.com/jfmoy/Fraise).
Fraise was originally forked from an earlier version of Smultron, maintained by Peter Borg (https://www.peterborgapps.com/smultron/).
